## Overview
This project presents **Virat Kohli’s year-wise cricket performance** across all formats — **Test, ODI, T20I, and IPL** — in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.  

The data is **kept live** through an automated pipeline that uses web scraping to update a Google Sheet, which is then connected to Power BI for real-time refresh.
